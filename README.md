Command-line version of [IdeaBlock Beta](https://ideablock.io) for git-like idea push in workflows.

# Prerequisites
- [Register](https://beta.ideablock.io) for a free IdeaBlock Beta account ₁
- Install [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Download
Install ideablock-cli globally using npm:
```bash
$ npm i -g ideablock-cli
```

# Usage
IdeaBlock CLI bundles the current version of all files in the current working directory and adds it to IdeaBlock as a new idea.
- Select "public" to make the idea public to instantly create immutable prior art
- Select "private" to keep the idea files private until you choose to make them public immutable prior art.
- Select "secret" to protect a trade secret - Your computer does a little bit of crypto magic to create a hash of the idea.  You keep the files, send IdeaBlock the hash, we take care of the rest.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/dir/with/idea/files/
$ ideablock init
```

The current version requires a flat file structure for the idea.  In other words, any subdirectories and subdirectory files under the directory from which `ideablock init` is called will be ignored.

# Beta
**Please be aware that this is beta software. Accordingly, the software will be frequently updated with bug fixes, sometimes without prior announcement.**

**Though the hashes generated by the software will be included in the Bitcoin and Litecoin Mainnets, the user must keep a copy of all zipped Idea Files in a safe place for subsequent proof of existence.**
